Description of our testing strategy:

As the provided tests are extremely trivial, we found it necessary to implement tests of varying size, connection complexity, latencies, and behaviors,
such as links dying repeatedly and coming back up as well as changes in link delay. The point of these test cases is to test whether our routing protocols
can find a new cheapest path in the event that a link in the current cheapest path dies or if the routing protocol can find a better path if the delay
changes between any links. Below are some specific scenarios that our test cases cover

With both DV and LS:

1. A simple network of 3 connected nodes. Can the protocol find a new path after a link in the best path dies (going through the other neighbor)?
If that link comes back up, can it recover that path, assuming it is still the cheapest? If a link's delay gets cheaper along the way, can the 
protocol pick up on that and take that path, even if the current best path is still valid?

2. Complex networks with high connectivity between each and every node. Stress tests alternative path finding

3. Various probabilities of packet drop. Can the information be communicated eventually, even if some information packets get lost?

4. Cases of rapid topology and rate changes

Our tests included many different permutations of these conditions to stress test.
