Network Partition and Healing. A ring network connecting nodes 1-5 in a loop.

Tests whether:
1) Handle link failure
2) Recover from link failure
3) Handle link delay changes

Should drop data packet on link failure and recover from link failure.

At time 5.00, node 1 sends data to node 4.
At time 20.00, link (2,3) fails, breaking one path.
At time 30.00, node 1 sends data to node 4; should use the alternative path.
At time 40.00, link (5,1) fails, partitioning the network.
At time 50.00, node 1 sends data to node 4; should fail due to partition.
At time 60.00, link (2,3) comes back up, healing the network.
At time 70.00, node 1 sends data to node 4; should succeed.
At time 80.00, link (5,1) comes back up, restoring the full ring.
At time 90.00, node 1 sends data to node 4; should use the shortest path.
