Large network with multuiple failures. An 8-node ring with additional chords connecting nodes for shortcut paths

Tests whether: 
1) handles link failures
2) recoveries
3) delay changes

The protocol should recompute routes as the network topology changes, maintaining connectivity despite failures.

At time 10.00, node 1 sends data to node 7.
At time 100.00, link (2,3) fails.
At time 110.00, node 1 sends data to node 7; should reroute accordingly.
At time 200.00, link (5,6) fails, creating potential routing challenges.
At time 210.00, node 1 sends data to node 7; must find an alternative path.
At time 300.00, link (2,3) comes back up.
At time 310.00, node 1 sends data to node 7; should adjust routes.
At time 400.00, link (5,6) comes back up.
At time 410.00, node 1 sends data to node 7; network is fully operational.
