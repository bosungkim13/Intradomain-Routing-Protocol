Test Rapid Topology changes. The protocol should cope with rapid topology changes without becoming unstable or generating excessive control traffic.

Tests whether:
1) Topology changes are handled gracefully at high rates

At time 1.00, node 1 sends data to node 3.
Between times 5.00 and 8.00, link (1,2) rapidly goes down and up.
At time 9.00, node 1 sends data to node 3.
