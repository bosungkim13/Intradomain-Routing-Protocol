Creates a triangle network with a link delay change.

Tests whether:
1) Handle assymetric link delay changes

The protocol should correctly handle asymmetric delays, updating routes based on the total path cost.

At time 5.00, node 1 sends data to node 3; should choose path through node 2.
At time 25.00, delay from node 1 to node 2 increases to 0.100.
At time 30.00, node 1 sends data to node 3; may choose direct link due to increased delay to node 2.
At time 50.00, delay from node 2 to node 1 decreases to 0.010.
At time 55.00, node 1 sends data to node 3; should reconsider routes based on updated delays.
