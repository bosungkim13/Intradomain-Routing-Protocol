Basic Link Failure and Recovery

Tests whether:
1) handles link failures
2) recoveries
3) delay changes

At time 1.00, node 1 sends data to node 3 (initial routing).
At time 50.00, link (1,3) fails.
At time 60.00, node 1 sends data to node 3; the protocol should route through node 2.
At time 70.00, link (1,3) comes back up.
At time 80.00, node 1 sends data to node 3; should use the direct link again.
At time 90.00, the delay on link (2,3) decreases to 0.005, making the path via node 2 potentially faster.
At time 100.00, node 1 sends data to node 3; the protocol should now prefer the path through node 2 if it recomputes routes based on delay.
